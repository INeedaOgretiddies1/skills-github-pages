GO-Ai Tokenomics

Supply & Caps
- Max supply: 100,000,000 GO-Ai (base token supply)
- Fallback reserve cap: 400,000,000 GO-Ai (locked, only used under strict fallback rules)

Initial distribution (example)
- Treasury & Development: 20%
- Liquidity & Market Making: 20%
- Community & Rewards (rotating): 25%
- Team & Advisors (vesting): 15%
- DAO Treasury & Grants: 15%
- Reserved Fallback: 5% (subject to governance release rules)

Governance & Vesting
- ve-style vote locking for parameter weight (longer lock → more voting power)
- Team tokens subject to multi-year vesting and cliffs

Reward Rotation Mechanism
- Daily / weekly rotation that awards roles (LPs, traders, active voters, developers, debuggers)
- Reward size governed by on-chain parameters and adjusted dynamically by AI-suggested policies

Fallback Economics
- Fallback reserve can be minted/burned only by DAO-approved proposals with multi-sig and time-locks
- Emergency drawdown requires supermajority to prevent unilateral abuse
