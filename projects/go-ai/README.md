# GO-Ai — Gas Oracle AI

GO-Ai is an autonomous, Chainlink-verified, AI-powered crypto infrastructure designed to dynamically regulate gas fees and liquidity using a biologically inspired 8+1 cell division architecture.

Status
- 🚧 Concept / Architecture Phase
- 📌 Documented as a design proposal (see issue #2)

Key Features
- 🔗 Chainlink Oracles for gas price and network data
- 🤖 AI-driven dynamic fee adjustment
- 🧬 Cellular modular contract design (8+1 cell model)
- 🏛 DAO-based governance and parameter voting
- 🔁 Rotating reward mechanisms and role-based incentives
- 🛡 Fallback, resilience, and recovery logic

Tokenomics (summary)
- Max supply: 100,000,000 GO-Ai
- Fallback reserve cap: 400,000,000
